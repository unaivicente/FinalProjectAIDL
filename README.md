INTRODUCTION

We started our project with a first aim that we proposed, try to use a transformer architecture directly using waveform raw data from our dataset. However, after numerous attemps we ended up trying many different architectures as we understood there were complexities using a transformer and 1D data that were out of our control and knowledge. Therefore, we are presenting in this present work a comparative study between different DL architectures using raw waveform as well as other methods with the same dataset.
